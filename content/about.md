This is the Naev development blog. Our primary form of communication (IRC) tends to keep development discussion hidden from many users, so we’ve decided to post periodic updates here to make our progress easier to follow. If you’re wondering what Naev is, well…

Naev is a 2D space trading and combat game, taking inspiration from the [Escape Velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_Velocity_%28video_game%29) series, among others.

You pilot a space ship from a top-down perspective, and are more or less free to do what you want. As the genre name implies, you’re able to trade and engage in combat at will. Beyond that, there’s an ever-growing number of storyline missions, equipment, and ships; Even the galaxy itself grows larger with each release. For the literarily-inclined, there are large amounts of lore accompanying everything from planets to equipment.

You can find downloads at [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/naev/files/) or on the <%= link_to( 'downloads', @items['/downloads.md'].path ) %> page. If you’re a Linux user, you can also get Naev from a few other sources, see the <%= link_to( 'downloads page', @items['/downloads.md'].path ) %> for more information.
